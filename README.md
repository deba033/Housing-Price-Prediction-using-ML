# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction

This project uses **regression analysis** to predict house sale prices based on multiple features from a structured housing dataset.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- Performed **EDA**, outlier handling, and correlation analysis
- Encoded categorical features and handled skewness
- Built and compared **OLS** and **Ridge Regression** models
- Evaluated performance using **R²** and **MSE**

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**, **Statsmodels**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📁 Dataset Summary

- **Rows**: 2,413  
- **Features**: 18 (17 independent + 1 target variable `SalePrice`)  
- **Types**: Integer, Float, and Categorical (Object)

---

## 📈 Results

- **OLS** performed slightly better (R² ≈ 0.83, lower MSE)
- All assumptions like linearity and normality mostly met
- Outliers and multicollinearity handled to improve accuracy
